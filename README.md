# Air Cleaner Design Repository

This repository contains the files and versions of the modified Corsi-Rosenthal Box (CR box) for Indian conditions.

The repository will contain different versions of the design marked with the date of commissioning. An associated folder will have the design in PDF along with the performance data collected and notes for the design. As the design evolves to be more efficienct while being low cost, the evolution will be recorded in this repository.
